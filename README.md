# stackoverflow-discord-bot
This discord bot uses the StackExchange API to serve answers to questions.
You can use <prefix>s <query> to search for a question.
This bot also uses code styling to make the code from the answers easier to read.

  Might not work 100% for questions involving an HTML query because the bot has to remove some HTML tags from the API response.
