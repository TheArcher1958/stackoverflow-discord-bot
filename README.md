# stackoverflow-discord-bot
This discord bot uses the StackExchange API to serve answers to questions.
This bot also uses code styling to make the code from the answers easier to read.

  Might not work 100% for questions involving an HTML query because the bot has to remove some HTML tags from the API response.
